Datapath Inputs:
clk, reset: generic inputs
pcEn: enable signal for program counter register
instrWrite: enable signal for instruction register
regWrite: enable signal for register file
writeBackSelect: control signal for a mux which chooses whether to write back data from memory or an alu result
dataToWriteSelect: mux control signal which chooses between the above write back data and the current program counter (for JAL instruction)
pcSrc: mux control signal which chooses between the alu result (for incrementing the pc by 1 or more for Bcond instructions) or a register (for Jcond instructions)
newAluInput:enable signal for registers between the alu and register file
aluSrc1Select: mux at the first alu input which chooses between the current program counter, the a register, constant 0 and constant 1
aluSrc2Select: mux at the second alu input which chooses between the b register, the immediate, constant 1 and constant 0
memDataInbound: line that connects ram and the cpu. can carry the instruction, LOAD info, etc.

Datapath Outputs:
aluOutIsZero: a T/F line which represents the alu having an output of 0 (will probably end up removing)
PSR: the flags set by the alu
instr: the instruction
memWriteData: holds the data that is being sent to memory to store (for STOR instruction)
memAddr: holds the address to store/load from
pcAddr: converts the program counter into an actual memory address for the next instruciton.
